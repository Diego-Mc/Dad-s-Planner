# 💡 &nbsp;Why Saderti?

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1676938677/saderti/ezgif-3-1c899ba416_tg3ztk.gif" style="border-radius: 8px">

I created Saderti to solve a specific problem my father faced as a manager at a plastic factory. Each weekend, he spent a significant amount of time creating schedules manually to ensure fairness in the workplace (each machine required different amount of work so it was important to fairly switch up not only the time shifts but also the machines each worker had to use in each scheduled week). I wanted to create a tool that would automate this process, ideally freeing up more time for managers to focus on other tasks. Saderti is the solution I came up with to solve this problem.

<br/>

# 🔧 &nbsp;Features

Saderti has several essential features that make it a powerful tool for managers. These include:

<br/>

## 👷‍♂️&nbsp;Worker Dashboard

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1676936232/saderti/mobile_10_g9rn24.png" style="border-radius: 8px">
</div>

With the worker dashboard, managers can view statistics based on each worker's performance, including time shifts and machines they've worked on. This feature provides managers with a quick overview of their workers' progress and performance.

<br/>

## 🎰 &nbsp;Machine Dashboard

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1676936238/saderti/mobile_11_axwkxr.png" style="border-radius: 8px">
</div>

The machine dashboard allows managers to view statistics based on how many times each worker has worked on a particular machine. This information helps managers make informed decisions when assigning workers to specific machines.

<br/>

## 📑 &nbsp;Schedules History

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1676936243/saderti/mobile_12_tfp1qj.png" style="border-radius: 8px">
</div>

The scheduling feature allows managers to create new schedules, edit existing ones, and export them to Excel. This feature saves managers a considerable amount of time and ensures that schedules are always up-to-date and organized in one place.

<br/>

## 📊 &nbsp;Automatic Scheduling

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1676936961/saderti/crop1_on1xl4.gif" style="border-radius: 8px">
</div>

The app provides a button that can automatically fill the schedule table using an algorithm that is based on previous statistics, making it easier for managers to assign workers to specific machines. This feature saves managers a significant amount of time and ensures that workers are assigned to different machines, creating a fair distribution between workers.
Before clicking the button the user can manually assign some workers and even lock some cells he would like to keep empty.

<br/>

## ⭐ &nbsp;Priority Setting

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1676936975/saderti/crop2_jlf7qi.gif" style="border-radius: 8px">
</div>

The priority setting feature allows managers to assign priority to each machine, which determines the order in which the algorithm starts assigning workers and contributes to the calculation of points each worker will be given to each machine in the algorithm described above. This feature ensures that workers are assigned to machines based on their priority.

<br/>

## 🏭 &nbsp;Machine's Workers Capacity

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1676936986/saderti/crop3_pxwlyj.gif" style="border-radius: 8px">
</div>

The machine's workers capacity setting feature allows managers to assign a workers capacity for each machine, which determines the amount of workers that are required/allowed to work in that machine for that scheduled week. This feature ensures the app is still usable even in dynamic and changing environments.

<br/>

# 📐 &nbsp;What's Next?

In the near future (maybe a week from now?), I plan to add new features to Saderti. These include a time schedule generator, which will allow managers to create a time shifts schedule in addition to the existing machines schedule, ideally using the statistics on workers time schedule history. I also plan to add a system for keeping score and feedback on each worker - This feature will allow managers to track performance and assign bonuses based on worker behavior and progress, this would also enrich the workers dashboard and add extra info to help managers make calculated decisions.
